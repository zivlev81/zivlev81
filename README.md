With a BS in Biology from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and a certificate program in progress at Analiza Education Center, 
I am a laboratory technician with over 9 years of experience in various industries.

I have worked as a lab tech at Maccabi Health Services, the Council for the Poultry Industry, and Bactochem, where I performed various tests, analyses, and experiments using different equipment,
software, and methods.

I have also developed skills in cloud computing, IT hardware support, and Python programming, which I use to enhance my work efficiency, 
accuracy, and innovation. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to the field of biology, as well as contributing to the health and well-being of society.
